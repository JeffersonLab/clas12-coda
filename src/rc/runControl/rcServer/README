TRANSITIONS =====================================================

netComponent::configure
netComponent::download
.....................

1. Set starting state (DA_CONFIGURING, DA_DOWNLOADING etc)


2. Send command to component to do transition


  codaDaConfigure
  codaDaDownload

3. Wait until status changed to desired one (DA_CONFIGURED, DA_DOWNLOADED)

  transitionFinished
  NOTE: booter, configurer and resetter have they own transitionFinished functions, others use transitioner::transitionFinished
