struggle with panedwindow/sash resizing

  /*
You could use a ConfigureNotify event handler for the children widgets of
the PanedWindow to find out when they are resized.
  */
  /*
XmNresizeCallback
  */

    Note that the SashAction action routine is not a direct action routine of the XmPaned,
    but rather an action of the Sash control created by the XmPaned
